The relationship between income, expenses, and wealth is fundamental in personal finance. 

- **Income** represents the money you earn from various sources, such as employment, investments, or business ventures.
- **Expenses** are the costs associated with living and maintaining a particular lifestyle.
- **Wealth** is the difference between your assets (what you own) and your liabilities (what you owe).
